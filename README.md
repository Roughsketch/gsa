Assembler for 65c816 written in Go.

This was a project I started a few years ago when I had first heard about the Go language. The current status of this program is unknown to me right now since at the time this was made I put little to no documentation in. Regardless, I am keeping this up so I may look at it in the future, but it is not meant to be taken as a serious and/or working project in its current state.
